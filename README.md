# Arjan Codes Code-Roasts

Refactoring projects in the [Arjan Codes](https://www.youtube.com/@ArjanCodes) code roast videos.

Objective is to refactor prior to watching the videos, and then compare my refactor to Arjan's.

Each directory will contain:
 - `before.py` - The file to be refactored.
 - `after.py` (or `after/` directory) - The code after my refactoring.
